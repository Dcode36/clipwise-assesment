# Assessment Project

## Overview

This project is a front-end development assignment that showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The goal was to mock the design provided in the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/design/sPQFevjsXyc1OptfKFf3AF/Internship-(Community)?node-id=0-1&t=2rLrrYypN8bHY6QP-1), with a strong emphasis on attention to detail.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: Utilized for interactive elements and dynamic functionality.
- **Bootstrap**: Leveraged to speed up development and write custom code. No code was copied from any existing components; all styles and components are created from scratch to maintain originality.
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Implemented to add smooth animations when elements scroll into view, enhancing user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Custom Styling**: Although Bootstrap was used as a framework, all styles are custom-written to fit the project requirements and design specifications.
- **Animations**: Smooth scrolling animations are added to provide a modern and engaging user experience.
